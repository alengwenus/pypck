[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# abstract-class-little-used - prevents from setting right foundation
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# global-statement - used for the on-demand requirement installation
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
# inconsistent-return-statements - doesn't handle raise
# not-an-iterable - https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2311
# logging-format-interpolation - ensure maintainability of future logging versions
# redefined-outer-name - fixtures in tests rely on redefinitions
# arguments-differ - acceptable if parameters are only added in a subclass
